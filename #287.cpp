Problem: Find the Duplicate Number
==============================================================
Given an array nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer 
is between 1 and n (inclusive), prove that at least one duplicate 
number must exist. Assume that there is only one duplicate number, 
find the duplicate one.

Note:
You must not modify the array (assume the array is read only).
You must use only constant, O(1) extra space.
Your runtime complexity should be less than O(n^2).
There is only one duplicate number in the array, but it could 
be repeated more than once.
